Grokking Algorithms – Practice Repository

This repository contains my personal implementations of algorithms and data structures from the book “Grokking Algorithms” by Aditya Bhargava.
The goal is to understand the fundamental concepts behind each algorithm by writing the code from scratch and experimenting with different approaches.

Structure

Each algorithm is organized by chapter or topic, including both recursive and iterative versions when relevant.
Example topics include:

Binary search

Selection sort

Recursion

Divide and conquer

Hash tables

Breadth-first search

Dijkstra’s algorithm

Greedy algorithms

Dynamic programming

Purpose

This repository serves as:

A learning tool for strengthening algorithmic thinking

A reference for common algorithm patterns

A place to experiment and visualize how algorithms work step by step

Technologies

Language: Python

Environment: VS Code / Jupyter Notebook (optional)
